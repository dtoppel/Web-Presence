  <h1>Dennis Toppel: Single Page Web Presence</h1>
  <p>My name is Dennis Toppel, and this is my Web Presence. I currently am a student at IIT, and am taking a Web Design Class. I have a GitHub page which I post my work and updates on said work, and any future projects will also be on my that page too.</p>
